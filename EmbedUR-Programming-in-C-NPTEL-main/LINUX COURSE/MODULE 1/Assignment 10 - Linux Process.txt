1.Open a terminal. Now spawn three shell processes one after another i.e. first spawn one shell, then from the spawned shell, spawn one new shell and so on. Now, how can you see the PID of the current shell ? How can you see the PID of the shell which is the grandparent of the current shell

Ans:
To create a shell process,type the sh command in the terminal for three times to create the shells one after another 
   sh
   sh
   sh

To check the current Process ID of a shell process need to use the below command to generate the PID
   echo $$

To check the PID of the grandparent of the current shell '-f' option is used to show all the processes running before with some better attributes
   ps -f

2.How can you see all the processes (both system & user processes) in your computer? The output can be quite large. How can you view the output as multipage output ? How can you store the output in a file named process_info?

Ans:
To see all the processes in the computer need to use the '-e' option to check all available processes
   ps -e

To view the output as multipage we need
   ps -e | more

To store the output in a file named specified above we need to redirect the stdin so that the contents of a file will be transfeered to the new file
   ps -e 1 >> process_info
