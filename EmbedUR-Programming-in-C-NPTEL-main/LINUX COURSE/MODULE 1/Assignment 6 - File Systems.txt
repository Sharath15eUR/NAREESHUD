1)Make a directory structure like this in your home directory.
         
Ans: To make a directory structure which is given above 
mkdir command is used to create a new directory 
	mkdir demodir

cd command is used to change the directory of a particular path
         cd demodir

using mkdir command we can able to create multiple files in a single instruction
         mkdir inside_demo also_inside_demo

to create a subdirectory of a given directory we can use '/' to enter inside a specific directory
         mkdir also_inside_demo/abc also_inside_demo/abc_123

2) Remove the also_inside_demo directory.

Ans: to remove a directory we can use the rmdir command 
         rmdir abc abc_123

here we need to change the directory 
         cd demodir

we can use two ways to remove a sub directory by using rmdir command followed by sub directory name
         rmdir also_inside_demo

              OR

we can use a force delete directory even if there is a presence of sub files in it 
         rm -rf also_inside_demo
