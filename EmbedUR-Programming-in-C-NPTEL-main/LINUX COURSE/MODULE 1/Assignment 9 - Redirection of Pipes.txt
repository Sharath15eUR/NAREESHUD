  1. Create a file name error_log in your current directory. Suppose you do not have any file named aa11 in your current directory. How can you redirect the error message to the file error_log when we apply the command "wc -l aa11"?  
         
Ans: the wc command is used to check the numbers characters lines and words in a file and in order to redirect the error message for stderr we need to use '2>>' to redirect the message of the given command
	 wc -l  aa11 2 >> error_log
     
How can you ensure that all the error log are appended to the error_log file?

Ans: to check that the error log is appended we can call the file using the cat command to check that whether its redirects to the corresponding message of stderr
         cat error_log

 2. Create files named test1, test2, testa, testb. How can you count the number of  files starting with test and then having only one digit in their name using only a single line command ?

Ans : cat command is used to create the following test files mentioned above 
         cat > test1
         cat > test2
         cat > testa
         cat > testb

To check the count of files which starts with the same file name but with different numbers using the numbers within square braces and display its count totally 
         ls -l test[0-9] | wc -l
